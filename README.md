Customer Churn Analysis Project Objective: The objective of this project is to analyze customer churn using Power BI. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon of customers ceasing their relationship with a company or business. By understanding the factors contributing to churn, businesses can implement strategies to retain customers and improve overall customer satisfaction and loyalty. Process:

Data Connection:
Ensure that you have access to the relevant dataset containing customer data. Connect Power BI to your dataset. This can be done through various data sources including CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, databases, or cloud services. Verify the integrity and completeness of the data to ensure accurate analysis.

Data Preparation: Cleaned the data by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Perform data transformations such as data type conversion, renaming columns, and creating calculated columns if necessary. Explore the dataset to gain insights into the variables and their relationships. Merge or append multiple datasets if needed for a comprehensive analysis. Use of basic dax function.

Data Modeling and Analysis: Build data models that represent the relationships between different entities in the dataset. Identify key metrics and KPIs relevant to customer churn analysis, such as customer demographics, purchase history, and engagement metrics. Utilize statistical analysis techniques to uncover patterns and trends that may indicate factors influencing customer churn. Apply machine learning algorithms if applicable to predict customer churn probabilities.

Data Visualization: Design using interactive and insightful visualizations to communicate findings effectively. Use a variety of charts, graphs, and tables to present key metrics and trends related to customer churn. Create dashboards that provide a comprehensive overview of customer churn metrics and insights. Ensure that visualizations are clear, concise, and visually appealing to facilitate easy interpretation. Usage:

Clone or download the repository containing the Power BI project files. Open the Power BI project file (.pbix) using Power BI Desktop. Refresh data connections to update the analysis with the latest data. Navigate through different pages or dashboards to explore various aspects of customer churn analysis. Interact with visualizations to drill down into specific data points and gain deeper insights. Contributing:
